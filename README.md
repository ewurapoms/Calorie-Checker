# Calorie-Checker
This is a simple app built using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. 
The calorie checker helps track the consumption of calories through breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack meals as well as that burned through exercise. Users can input information about their meals and exercise activities, and the calorie counter calculates the resulting output.
